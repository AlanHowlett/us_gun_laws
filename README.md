## Project Motivation
In the United States, it seems we never have to go more than a few weeks without hearing about another mass shooting. With each new incident comes renewed calls to strengthen gun control laws, expand federal background checks, and get rid of assault rifles. Though the opposing faction promptly dismisses each appeal by citing 2nd Amendment rights, other discussions of practicality often emerge. Specifically, the efficacy of such laws is often called into question.

How do we know which laws work and which ones donâ€™t? Are there any laws that can be implemented without infringing on individual rights and liberties? Here, we will use the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to see if we can find answers to those questions.

## Data Sources
### Center for Disease Control - National Center for Health Statistics
Firearm mortality rates, as well as overall homicide and suicide rates from 1991-2016, was available via CDC's [WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mortSQL.html) tool.

### Giffords Law Center
Initial analysis utilzed the grading scale from [Giffords](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/scorecard/) to determine if better grades result in lower mortality rates.

### Everytown Research
Rather than rely on an opaque grading scale, [Everytown Research](https://everytownresearch.org/navigator/trends.html?dataset=background_checks) maintains a web database that tracks changes in specific features of gun laws on a state-by-state basis since 1991. Gun laws are broken down into 85 dimensions across 8 categories:

- Background Checks
- Criminals
- Domestic Violence
- Drugs and Alcohol
- Mental Illness
- Minimum Age
- Permitting Process
- Other

### Global Terrorism Database
In addition to homicide rates, we would also like to know what type of impact, if any, gun laws have on mass shootings. University of Maryland's [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) provides international data for all types of terrorist attacks, including breakdown by weapon type.

## Redefining the Variables
The most common metric used to support arguments that gun laws are effective is the firearm mortality rate. Multiple studies show that as gun laws get stronger, firearm mortality rates drop. Here, we see that as state law grades increase, firearm mortality rates decrease:

Despite the clear correlation, gun rights advocates generally point to two problems with this approach:

1. Grading scale is opaque and assumes lower mortality rates are a result of specific laws (assuming the conclusion).
2. People who commit homicide with a firearm are likely to use another weapon if guns are not accessible. If firearm homicide rates go down, but overall homicide rates remain the same, then gun laws don't really help anything

We examine these criticisms by plotting grades against overall homicide and overall suicide rates in a simple linear regression:

Based on the r-square values, it is observed that suicide rates are much more responsive to changes in gun laws than homicide rates. Interestingly enough, when measuring the impact of neighbor state law grades on homicide rates in the target state, a stronger relationship is observed:

The implication here is that, if we want to predict homicide rates in California, we can do so with better accuracy by examing laws in Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon rather than California law itself.

These results show that there is validity to objections raised by gun rights advocates. Therefore, we take a new approach to analysis of state gun laws by redifining the variables.

- **Independent Variables**: Features of gun laws as defined by Everytown Research in home and target states.
- **Target Variables**: Overall homicide rate and frequency of mass shootings.

Taking this approach, we can gain more insight to specific features of gun laws that are most effective, and we eliminate concerns highlighted in point 2 by gun rights advocates.

## Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Everytown Research frames features as a series of yes/no questions, though application can be varied. For example, a question that asks if individuals with felonies are restricted from owning guns, the answer might apply to a few predefined categories:

- Handgun Possession
- Handgun Purchase
- Long Gun/Rifle Possession
- Long Gun/Rifle Purchase

All categories are weighted equally. So, responses to questions are ranked according to how restrictive the laws are. For example, a yes response to the above mentioned question for all categories would get a score of 4. If the response was yes for only handgun possession and no for everything else, the score would be 1. The higher the score, the more restrictive that feature of law.

The mean of neighbor state responses are also calculated and used as predictors as well. This provides greater insight to understanding how neighbor state laws can undermine laws in the target state.

## Backward Elimination
It doesn't help to use all 85 features of gun laws to make predictions. Instead, we want to isolate a select few questions that can be used to accurately predict homicide rates and have substantial variance in the rates such that the difference is, in a practical sense, meaningful. 

To accomplish this, a multiple linear regression model was created, and features were removed one at a time until all remaining features were found to be statistically significant. From there, features were ranked based on their correllation coefficients, with the top 20 remaining for more in depth analysis. Below we can see how these questions correlate with one another, as well as with the target variable in the bottom row.

However, attempting to predict homicide rates with multiple linear regression analysis, we were unable to acheive accuracy rates any better than using grades of neighbor states.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
Six different model architectures were used (including one neural network) with just over 1400 variants of those architectures through use of a hyperparameter gridsearch. Each model was trained on 80% of the data using 5-fold cross-validation, then tested on the remaining 20%. The explained variance scores for the top performing variant of each model can be found below, with XGBoost Regression achieving the highest score on test data.

We can also plot the predicted homicide rates against the actual homicide rates to help visualize the accuracy of the model. The blue line represents predicted rates, while red dots represent actual rates.
