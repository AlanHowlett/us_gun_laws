A person subject to an extreme risk protection order is prohibited from possessing or purchasing firearms and is required to surrender all firearms in his or her possession to local law enforcement. 

A petitioner can request that an ex parte extreme risk protection order be issued before a hearing by giving detailed allegations based on person knowledge that the respondent poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others in the near future by having in his or her custody or control, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm. The court must issue the ex parte order if if finds there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondent poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others in the near future by having in his or her custody or control, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm. Within 14 days of issuing the ex parte order, the court must have a hearing to determine if a one-year extreme risk protection order should be issued. 

Upon holding a hearing for a petition for an extreme risk protection order, a court must issue a one-year order if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others by having in his or her custody or control, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm.

Penal Code § 18175,"Three types of gun violence restraining orders are available to either an immediate family member or a law enforcement officer to prohibit and enjoin a person from purchasing or possessing any firearms or ammunition and ordering that person to surrender all firearms and ammunition in his or her possession. 

A temporary emergency gun violence restraining order may be sought by a law enforcement officer on an ex parte basis. The court may issue the order if there is reasonable cause to believe that (1) the subject poses an immediate and present danger of causing personal injury to himself or others by having a firearm, and (2) the order is necessary to prevent personal injury to the subject or others because less restrictive alternatives either have proven ineffective or would be inadequate or inappropriate under the circumstances.

An ex parte gun violence restraining order may be sought by an immediate family member or a law enforcement officer. The court may issue the order if there is a substantial likelihood that (1) the subject poses a significant danger, in the near future, of personal injury to himself or others by having a firearm, and (2) the order is necessary to prevent personal injury to the subject or others because less restrictive measures either have proven ineffective or would be inadequate or inappropriate under the circumstances. Within 21 days after the order is issued, the court must hold a hearing to determine if a final gun violence restraining order should be issued.
 
A gun violence restraining order issued after notice and hearing may be sought by an immediate family member or law enforcement officer. The court may issue the order if there is clear and convincing evidence that (1) the subject poses a significant danger of personal injury to himself or others by having a firearm, and (2) the order is necessary to prevent personal injury to the subject or others because less restrictive alternative either have proven ineffective or are inadequate or inappropriate under the circumstances.

A person who is a respondent to ERPO, whether issued ex parte or after a hearing, is prohibited from possessing and acquiring firearms and is required to surrender any firearms in the respondent’s possession. A law enforcement officer, or a family or household member, can petition for an ERPO. A court must issue an ex parte ERPO if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent presents a risk in the near future, including an imminent risk, of suicide or of causing physical injury to any other person. Upon service of the ERPO on the respondent, the respondent must surrender their firearms, within 24 hours, to local law enforcement, a dealer, or a third party who can lawfully possess the firearms. If a law enforcement officer serves the ERPO, the officer must request immediate surrender of the firearms. The respondent has 30 days after service to request a hearing. The court must hold a hearing within 21 days of receiving a request. If the respondent does not request a hearing, the ex parte ERPO expires after 1 year. If the respondent requests a hearing, the court must issue a 1-year ERPO if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent presents a risk in the near future, including an imminent risk, of suicide or of causing physical injury to another person. In deciding whether the petitioner has met their burden of proof required to issue the order, the court must consider several factors, including the following: a history of suicidal threats or acts of violence against others; a history of use or threatened use of physical force against others; convictions for violent misdemeanors, or crimes of stalking, domestic violence, driving under the influence, or cruelty against animals; recent unlawful and reckless use or brandishing of a weapon; violation of a domestic violence restraining order; and recent acquisition or attempted acquisition of a firearm."
